>> pip install django
>> django-admin startproject mysite .
if you want to make this project in another folder, write first >> cd name-of-folder-or-path

now you have a project. to make an app, write
>> python manage.py startapp name_of_the_app
in my case, I need to write python3.10 as the first word

mysite contains configuration files for the project
name_of_the_app contains configuration files for the app

to run the app we write
>> python manage.py runserver     OR python3.10


to write the changes from models (eg. database creation)
>> python manage.py makemigratios
>> python manage.py migrate


how to make an admin
>> python manage.py createsuperuser
follow the terminal and create a user name and a password
